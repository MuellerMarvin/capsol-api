# Capsol API

An Api for a proposed application, that would drop "capsols" on a map, which could contain various types of data (such as audio, images, text) to tell a story that happened at the point the 'capsol' (for timecapsule) was dropped.

# Example config.json
```json
{
    "database": {
        "connectionString": "<MongoDB Connection String>"
    },
    "networking": {
        "port": 3000
    }
}
```
